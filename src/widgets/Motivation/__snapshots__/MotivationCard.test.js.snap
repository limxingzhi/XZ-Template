            This app skeleton design was loosely based around another design I made for a school project. It originates from the idea where it has to be incredibly easy to add in new functionality. If I were to pick a targeted audience for this, I will say its for students trying to quickly kick start a react project without having to set up a ton of boilerplate code like a navigation bar, routing, TypeScript support, determining how the app strucutre start should look like, all that boring stuff.

            State management is also pre-configured with redux toolkit.
